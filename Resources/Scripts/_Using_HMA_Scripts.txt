What are These?
===============
.hma files are little custom scripts that add or changes features in your game.
The scripts are named based on their supported games, then an underscore, then the effect they have.
The scripts are organized into directories based on what they do:
- 'Add Mechanics From Later Generations' includes things like the Physical/Special split from Gen 4
  or the Fairy Type from Gen 6. Add things from this folder to make your game more 'moddern'.
- 'Patches' include simple changes meant to solve specific problems, like allowing Gen 1 pokemon to
  evolve to new forms without the national dex in FR/LG, or removing the contest tab from R/S/E.
- 'Update Existing Mechanics' don't change anything about your game on their own, but they adjust
  the game code to make it more flexible and easy to customize.
  For example, you could make possible to add more starters to Emerald, or edit wild pokemon odds.

How do I use These?
===================
1. Open the .gba you want to edit with HexManiacAdvance.
2. Click and drag the .hma file over HexManiacAdvance.
   You should see a preview describing what the script will do.
3. Release. The script will make edits to your rom.
4. If you're happy with the changes, save.

Note:
.hma files are just text files. You can open them and read them if you want.
Some scripts include content that you can customize before running.
